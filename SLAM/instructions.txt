Problem Requirements (Step-by-Step Instructions):
1. The Preprocessor & Global Setup (Unit II):

Define a macro MAX_NAME as 50.

Define a macro function CHECK_BIT(num, pos) using bitwise operators to check if a specific bit is set.

Use the Token Pasting Operator (##) in a macro to generate variable names for error codes (e.g., ERROR_1, ERROR_2).

Include standard headers: stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, math.h (Unit IV).

2. The Data Structure (Unit III): Define a structure UserRecord containing:

int id: Unique ID.

char name[MAX_NAME]: User name.

union Data: A union containing float salary and int access_level (Assume a user has either a salary OR an access level, not both).

struct Flags: A bit-field structure containing:

unsigned int is_active : 1

unsigned int is_admin : 1

unsigned int has_error : 1

3. Memory & Storage (Unit II & III):

Command Line Arguments: The program must verify that a filename was passed in argv[1].

Dynamic Allocation: Ask the user how many records to create/edit. Use malloc or calloc to allocate an array of UserRecord structs.

Storage Class: Create a function void log_activity() that uses a static integer variable to count and print how many operations have been performed during the session.

4. The Logic & Functions (Unit I & II):

Recursion: Write a recursive function int calculate_checksum(int id) that sums the digits of the ID (e.g., ID 123 returns 6). Store this result temporarily or print it.

Pointer Arithmetic: Create a function that accepts a pointer to the array of records. Iterate through the array using only pointer arithmetic (e.g., ptr++), not array indexing (arr[i]), to print details.

Call by Reference: Create a function void toggle_admin(struct UserRecord *u) that takes a pointer to a struct and uses Bitwise XOR (^) to toggle the is_admin bit-field.

5. File Handling (Unit III):

Open the file in Binary Mode (rb+ or wb+).

Implement a "Modify Record" feature:

Ask the user for an ID/Index.

Use fseek to jump directly to that record's location in the file.

Use ftell to confirm the position.

Update the record and write it back using fwrite.

6. Control Flow (Unit I):

Implement a switch-case driven menu inside a do-while loop.

The menu options should be:

Add New Records (Dynamic Input).

View All Records (Pointer Traversal).

Toggle Admin Rights (Bitwise Ops).

Save & Exit.

Use continue to restart the loop if invalid input is given.

Use goto (sparingly) to jump to a cleanup section (freeing memory) upon a critical error.
