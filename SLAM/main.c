 * Scenario: You have been hired to maintain a legacy database for a secure facility.
 *           The system stores user records in a binary file.
 *           Your task is to write a C program that accepts the database filename via Command Line Arguments,
 *           loads the data into Dynamic Memory, allows manipulation of records using
 *           Pointers and Bitwise operations, and saves the changes back
 *           to the file using Random Access File Handling.
